# Patient Representation Learning for COVID-19 Medical Tasks Based on Heterogeneous-Quality Online EHRs

The source code for *Patient Representation Learning for COVID-19 Medical Tasks Based on Heterogeneous-Quality Online EHRs*

Thanks for your interest in our work and since it is under review, we only upload the model here.
The codes for the medical findings will be release soon after review.

## Requirements

* Install python, pytorch. We use Python 3.7.3, Pytorch 1.5.0.
* If you plan to use GPU computation, install CUDA

## Data preparation
The data for HM COVID-19 Dataset are open according to [here](https://www.hmhospitales.com/coronavirus/covid-data-save-lives/english-version)
The data for Early COVID-19 Dataset are open according to [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0180-7)


## Run MAPLE

All the hyper-parameters and steps are included in the `.ipynb` file, you can run it directly.
